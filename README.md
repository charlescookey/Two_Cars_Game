The setup file for the Two Cars Game

## Two_Cars
This game is based off the "2 Cars" android game created by "Ketchapp". I decided to recreate it as a Desktop application as my Udacity C++ nanodegree Capstone Project. This is what the game looks like when launched.

The idea of the game is to avoid the Squares and not miss a single Circle.
